Tasks:
- Put the sidebar in one file and make it included in all other html files so I
don't have to worry about changing every single file.
- Figure out the whole pipeline for rendering articles and such. (Note: this probably goes in tandem with the above task)
    - I probably want to use pandoc for converting markdown with latex (I decided that this would mesh better than solely just latex) to html
    - A simple python script can be made to manage the articles?
    - Probably we don't need to look into filters right now right surely
        - In the case that eventually we do have to use filters, just use https://scorreia.com/software/panflute/
          because flipping between Lua and Python probably doesn't make too much sense
        - Although if things take too long to figure out/debug, just go with Lua idk
- Probably use the libertine font for actual article writing since it's basically a signature
    - https://github.com/iliakonnov/linlibertine (using the woff2 file)
    - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face-in-css/
    - Actually I might keep Source Sans because it is nice and fits the rest of the page
- Fix the CSS and stuff because unfortunately the website is not responsive and doesn't look the greatest greatest
- Get some better styling potentially for tags and such
- Fix the main web pages (articles, tags, about me) and get integration working with render.py
- Port all the things I've written and have fun :D
