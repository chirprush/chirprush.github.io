# Chirprush Blog

This is my blog website! It's mainly a medium-weight python wrapper over pandoc, which renders from Markdown (with LaTeX support) to HTML, although there is some rendering done by the python script. I intend to write about math and computer science mainly, but I do want to branch out in the future.
