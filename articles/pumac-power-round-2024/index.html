                </div>

                <p>This year was actually my first participating in <a
                href="https://jason-shi-f9dm.squarespace.com/">PUMAC</a>
                and it was a really cool experience! Our team placed 6th
                for the team round which was honestly a surprise, and
                the day of the competition was certainly challenging,
                but what stood out to me the most was the power
                round.</p>
                <p>The concept of the PUMAC power round is rather
                simple: your team is thrown straight into a specifically
                chosen topic in pure mathematics and given roughly a
                week to figure it out, solving proof-based problems
                along the way. Personally, I think this is a really cool
                contrast to the standard math competition experience,
                which is based on solving hard, concrete problems in a
                very small amount of time. It's a great window into
                higher level mathematics (in fact, the contest itself
                had a question that was stated to be an active area of
                resesarch).</p>
                <p><a
                href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/570450471d07c094a39efaed/t/673a4bada1036103a5a7897f/1731873709355/Power2024_Updated_1117.pdf">This
                year's power round</a> introduced the field of measure
                theory (the formalization of volumes and dimensions to
                even perhaps pathological sets) to give a rigorous
                exploration and characterization of fractals. Below is
                my attempt to capture the essence of the commentary
                given, and a compartmentalization of our team solutions,
                at least as far as we got during the contest window. I
                hope you enjoy!</p>
                <p><em>Note: there are some minor changes and
                conventions that should be pointed out. Namely, <span
                class="math inline">\(\subset\)</span> during this
                contest denotes subset or subset equals. In addition, I
                will <strong>switch around the order</strong> of some
                problems if it is more conducive for understanding. Much
                of the exposition is structured similarly to the power
                round document (all credit to the contest organizers for
                this), but I will occasionally interject with some
                intuition.</em></p>

                <p>The first half of contest document is spent building
                up the idea of the Hausdorff measure, the quintessential
                tool for working with fractals later on. This rising
                action starts with the definition of <span
                class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebras and a
                measure itself.</p>

                <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> on a set
                <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a set of
                subsets of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>

                in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>, its

                <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> doesn't) is in
                <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span></li>
                <li>For any <a

                list of sets in <span

                the set containing all elements in any set of the list)
                is in <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>.</li>

                <p>This certainly doesn't feel conducive to measuring
                volumes, and it's certainly esoteric on first glance.
                Indeed, as with many things in pure mathematics, we're
                trading off the confusion of working backwards from
                intuition with the promise of rigour and consistency.
                Before we get into the "why" of <span
                class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebras, let's
                first take a look at the definition of a measure so
                their interplay can help us better understand what's
                going on.</p>
                <p><strong>Definition.</strong> We call a function <span
                class="math inline">\(\mu : \Sigma \to \mathbb{R} \cup
                \{ \infty \}\)</span> a <strong>measure</strong> over a
                <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra
                <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span> if</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li><span class="math inline">\(\mu(\emptyset) =
                0\)</span></li>
                <li><span class="math inline">\(\mu(E) \ge 0\)</span>
                for all <span class="math inline">\(E \in
                \Sigma\)</span></li>
                <li>For any set <span class="math inline">\(\{ E_i \}_{i
                = 1}^\infty \subset \Sigma\)</span> of <em>disjoint</em>
                sets, <span class="math display">\[
                \mu \left( \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty E_i \right) = \sum_{i
                = 1}^\infty
                \mu(E_i)
                .\]</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>This definition much better codifies how we
                intuitively view volumes. Condition 1 tells us that
                empty sets should have <span
                class="math inline">\(0\)</span> volume. Condition 2
                tells us that volumes can't be negative. Condition 3
                tells us that the volume of a set is the sum of the
                volumes of its smaller pieces. It should be noted that
                there are many different ways of defining valid measures
                on sets. This definition merely tells us what conditions
                a function should obey for it to be considered a part of
                the class of functions called a measure.</p>
                <p>The reason why we work over a <span
                class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra (in
                particular we assume to be working with the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_set">Borel
                algebra</a> over <span
                class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>) is because
                assigning measure values to every single subset of <span
                class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> either ends
                up with the measure being equivalently <span
                class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or just blowing up to
                infinity all the time. See more discussion <a
                href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/199280/why-do-we-need-sigma-algebras-to-define-probability-spaces">here</a>.
                For the contest, it suffices to take this at face value,
                although I do recommend the curious reader to go more in
                depth.</p>
                <p>Combining together a set, a <span
                class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra over that
                set, and a measure over the <span
                class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra gives a
                measure space.</p>
                <p>The next few problems concern themselves with

                <p>For the first case, observe that if <span

                Hausdorff measure, a particular measure that gives us a
                way to quantifying dimensions and volume. To get to
                volumes, we'll first start from something that we are
                very familiar with in higher dimensions: distance.</p>

                    |S| := \sup_{x, y \in S} |x - y|

                <p>In other words, the longest possible length across
                all segments in the set is the diameter. The absolute
                value signs denote the usual Euclidean norm in <span
                class="math inline">\(n\)</span> dimensions. Combining
                this diameter with set unions allows us to create a
                controllably precise covering of any set.</p>

                <strong>outer <span
                class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-dimensional Hausdorff
                measure</strong> of a set <span
                class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as <span
                class="math display">\[
                    \mathcal{H}^s_\delta (S) := \inf \left\{ \sum_{i =
                1}^\infty |U_i|^s :
                    \{U_i \}_i \text{ is a } \delta \text{-cover of } S
                \right\}
                ,\]</span> where the infimum is taken over all <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-covers of <span
                class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
                <p>Before we fully dive into what this is exactly
                saying, we'll go through some problems to glean
                important characteristics of the Hausdorff measure. We
                will briefly mention, though, that intuitively this
                should be close to a notion of <span
                class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-dimensional volume.
                Thinking in terms of units, a set with dimension <span
                class="math inline">\(s\)</span> should have volume with
                units of length to the <span
                class="math inline">\(s\)</span> power. In addition, the
                infima across <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-covers makes it so
                that we are measuring the volume of the most accurate,
                refined covering of the set.</p>
                <p>Using the below problem, we can refine this further
                to only consider all <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-covers where each
                element is open and convex.</p>

                <div class="solution-contents">
                <p>We shall firstly prove the following very useful
                lemma:</p>
                <p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Fix points <span
                class="math inline">\(x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>
                and let <span class="math inline">\(p(t) = tx + (1 -
                t)y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(p :
                [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. Then, <span
                class="math display">\[
                    |z - p(t)| \le \max \{ |z - x|, |z - y| \}
                .\]</span></p>
                <p><em>Proof.</em> There exists a unique plane passing
                through <span class="math inline">\(x, y, z\)</span>.
                Thus, we have an analogous problem in geometry that,
                given a segment <span class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>
                and a point <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we
                must show that for any point <span
                class="math inline">\(C\)</span> on segment <span
                class="math inline">\(AB\)</span>, <span
                class="math inline">\(PC \le \max\{ PA, PB \}\)</span>,
                but this is immediately obvious, as either <span
                class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span
                class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is farther away than
                <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> from the altitude
                (the segment with the shortest length). <span
                class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
                <p>Next, let's construct the convex hull of <span
                class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. Namely, let <span
                class="math display">\[
                    H := \{ tx + (1 - t) y \mid t \in [0, 1], x, y \in E
                \}
                .\]</span> With this, we have the following claim:</p>
                <p><strong>Claim.</strong> <span
                class="math inline">\(|H| = |E|\)</span>.</p>
                <p><em>Proof.</em> From the definition of diameter, we
                can split the supremum into three cases as follows:
                <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
                    |H| &amp;= \sup_{x, y \in H} |x - y| \\
                    &amp;= \max \{ \sup_{x, y \in E} |x - y|, \sup_{x
                \in E, y \in H \setminus E} |x - y|, \sup_{x, y \in H
                \setminus E} |x - y| \}
                .\end{align*}\]</span> It suffices to prove that the
                last two suprema are bounded above by the first (which
                is <span class="math inline">\(|E|\)</span>) to show
                that <span class="math inline">\(|H| = |E|\)</span>.</p>
                <p>Case <span class="math inline">\(x \in E, y \in H
                \setminus E\)</span>: Because <span
                class="math inline">\(y \in H \setminus E\)</span>,
                there must exist points <span class="math inline">\(a, b
                \in E\)</span> such that for some <span
                class="math inline">\(t \in [0, 1]\)</span>, <span
                class="math inline">\(y = ta + (1-t) b\)</span>. By our
                above lemma, <span class="math inline">\(|x - y| \le
                \max\{ |x - a|, |x - b| \}\)</span>, so if we take WLOG
                <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to be the
                furthest endpoint then we have that <span
                class="math inline">\(|x-y| \le |x - a|\)</span>.
                Because we can find such an <span
                class="math inline">\(a \in E\)</span> for all <span
                class="math inline">\(x \in E, y \in H \setminus
                E\)</span>, we must have that <span
                class="math display">\[
                    \sup_{x \in E, y \in H \setminus E} |x - y| \le
                \sup_{x, y \in E} |x - y|
                .\]</span></p>
                <p>Case <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in H \setminus
                E\)</span>: We proceed similarly. There must exist
                points <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c, d \in
                E\)</span> where for some <span class="math inline">\(s,
                t \in [0, 1]\)</span> we have <span
                class="math inline">\(x = cs + (1 - s)d, y = at + (1 -
                t)b\)</span>. Applying the above lemma, we can say WLOG
                that <span class="math inline">\(|x - y| \le |x -
                a|\)</span> and again WLOG <span
                class="math inline">\(|x - a| \le |c - a|\)</span>.
                Since, we can always find such <span
                class="math inline">\(a, c \in E\)</span>, we must have
                <span class="math display">\[
                    \sup_{x, y \in H \setminus E} |x - y| \le \sup_{x, y
                \in E} |x - y|
                .\]</span></p>
                <p>Thus, <span class="math display">\[
                    |H| = \sup_{x, y \in E} |x - y| = |E|
                ,\]</span> which concludes our proof. <span
                class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
                <p>From here, define <span
                class="math inline">\(U\)</span> as <span
                class="math display">\[
                    U := \bigcup_{x \in H} B_x (r)
                ,\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>
                is some fixed radius we shall determine later. Clearly,
                as <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the union
                of an arbitrary number of open balls, <span
                class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is ensured to be open
                and convex.</p>
                <p>Now, notice that <span class="math display">\[
                    |U| = \sup_{x, y \in H, |z_1| = |z_2| = r} | x - y +
                z_1 + z_2 |
                ,\]</span> and by the triangle inequality <span
                class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
                    \sup_{x, y \in H, |z_1| = |z_2| = r} | x - y + z_1 +
                z_2 | &amp;\le \sup_{x, y \in H} |x - y| + |z_1| + |z_2|
                \\
                    &amp;= |H| + 2r \\
                    &amp; = |E| + 2r
                .\end{align*}\]</span> Thus, if we're given any fixed
                <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon &gt; 0\)</span>,
                we can choose <span class="math inline">\(r =
                \varepsilon / 4\)</span> and obtain an open, convex set
                <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> of sufficiently
                small diameter.</p>

                <p>Of course, this measure is dependent on the parameter
                <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> controlling

                mentioned earlier that we want to refine our covers, so
                what happens to the measure when we are varying <span

                <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>, compute the sum
                of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> powers of each
                element, and take <span class="math inline">\(\delta \to
                0^+\)</span>, we cannot say that the Hausdorff measure
                is what I've computed. The Hausdorff measure takes the
                infimum over all <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-covers, meaning
                that at most I can say the measure is less than or equal
                to what I've computed. This tells us an upper bound, but
                not a lower bound.</p>
                <p>There is one exception to this case, however. If we
                can prove that <span
                class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^s(E) \le 0\)</span>,
                nonnegativity tells us that <span
                class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^s(E)\)</span> must be
                identically <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
                <p>Another thing that I found hard to understand during
                the contest before doing any concrete examples was how
                the Hausdorff dimension and the behavior around it
                actually arose. So, let's take a concrete example of
                trying to compute the Hausdorff measure of <span
                class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>.</p>
                <p>Consider the <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-covering where we
                take intervals of length <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta / 2\)</span>, resulting in
                <span class="math inline">\(2 / \delta\)</span> total
                intervals. Thus, <span class="math display">\[
                    \mathcal{H}^s_{\delta} ([0, 1]) \approx \sum_{i =
                1}^\infty |U_i|^s = \left( \frac{\delta}{2} \right)^s
                \cdot \frac{2}{\delta} = C \delta^{s - 1}
                ,\]</span> for some constant <span
                class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Taking <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to be very small,
                we see that the measure is infinite for <span
                class="math inline">\(s &lt; 1\)</span> (because then
                the exponent is negative), finite for <span
                class="math inline">\(s = 1\)</span>, and <span
                class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for <span
                class="math inline">\(s &gt; 1\)</span>. Thus, as we
                would expect, the dimension of the interval is <span
                class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Of course, this isn't
                rigorous at all since we haven't proven that our <span
                class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>-cover is the most
                optimal one, but the intuition still holds.</p>
                <p>Further, we actually can glean something from this
                argument. Remember when I said that if we can show an
                upper bound of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>,
                we have a definite value for the Hausdorff measure? If
                we take <span class="math inline">\(s &gt; 1\)</span>,
                we get exactly this. So, we can say rigorously that
                <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}^s([0, 1]) =
                0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(s &gt;
                1\)</span>. This alone doesn't tell us that <span
                class="math inline">\(\dim [0, 1] = 1\)</span>, but it
                does tell us that <span class="math inline">\(\dim[0, 1]
                \le 1\)</span>, which is very useful.</p>

                <p>First, let's consider the case when <span

                <p>What exactly do we mean when we talk of a fractal?
                Intuitively, a fractal is a set of points that is
                self-similar when we take copies, scale the copies down,
                translate them, and glue them together in some way. We
                make this intuition concrete with the idea of
                contractions and iterated function systems (IFSs).</p>
                <p><strong>Definition.</strong> A function <span
                class="math inline">\(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to
                \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is called a
                <strong>contraction</strong> if there exists some
                constant <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; c &lt;
                1\)</span> such that for every <span
                class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>,
                <span class="math inline">\(|f(x) - f(y)| = c|x -
                y|\)</span>. The value <span
                class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is called the
                <strong>contraction ratio</strong> for <span
                class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
                <p>Contractions take any set and make lengths between
                points less, shifting the points closer to eachother.
                This definition takes care of the scaling and
                translating part of fractals. The next definition
                handles the multiple copies part:</p>
                <p><strong>Definition.</strong> An <strong>iterated

                <p>Each function has the same domain and codomain, but

                Obviously, the base case for when <span

                <li><p>We claim that an example of such a function is
                <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = \sqrt{x^2 +

                verify that this function satisfies weak
                contraction.</p>
                <p><strong>Claim.</strong> For <span
                class="math inline">\(x \ne y\)</span>, <span
                class="math display">\[
                     |\sqrt{x^2 + 1} - \sqrt{y^2 + 1}| &lt; |x - y|
                .\]</span></p>
                <p><em>Proof.</em> Squaring both sides, doing some
                algebra, and squaring again yields <span

                     x^2 + 1 + y^2 + 1 - 2\sqrt{(x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)}
                &amp;&lt; x^2 + y^2 - 2xy \\
                     2 - 2 \sqrt{(x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)} &amp;&lt; -2xy \\
                     (x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) &amp;&gt; (xy + 1)^2
                .\end{align*}\]</span> But, <span
                class="math inline">\((x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1) - (xy + 1)^2 =
                (x - y)^2\)</span>, which is strictly greater than <span
                class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for <span
                class="math inline">\(x \ne y\)</span>, so our function
                satisfies the weak contraction condition. <span
                class="math inline">\(\blacksquare\)</span></p>
                <p>Now, we must prove that <span
                class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> has no fixed point.
                This is equivalent to the <span
                class="math inline">\(f(x) - x = 0\)</span> having no
                real solution. Clearly <span class="math inline">\(f(x)
                &gt; 0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(x &lt;
                0\)</span> (and thus <span class="math inline">\(f(x) -
                x &gt; 0\)</span>), so we are left to consider when
                <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; 0\)</span>. Observe,
                however, in this case that <span
                class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x^2 + 1} &gt; \sqrt{x^2} =
                x\)</span>, so there cannot be a solution when <span
                class="math inline">\(x &gt; 0\)</span>. Thus, <span
                class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> has no fixed

                <p>Now that we've found a way to formalize our fractals,
                we can actually use the tools we've developed before to
                get a better understanding of them. Specifically, the
                contest gives us a very useful tool for computing the
                dimension of the fractals. Firstly, consider the
                following definition:</p>
                <p><strong>Definition.</strong> An IFS <span
                class="math inline">\((f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m)\)</span>
                satisfies the <strong>open set condition</strong>
                (<strong>OSC</strong>) if there exists a bounded,
                non-empty open set <span class="math inline">\(U \subset
                \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> such that for each <span
                class="math inline">\(i \ne j\)</span>, <span
                class="math display">\[
                    f_i(U) \cap f_j(U) = \emptyset
                \]</span> and <span class="math display">\[
                    U \supset \bigcup_{i = 1}^m f_i(U)
                .\]</span></p>
                <p>We are then given the following theorem:</p>
                <p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span
                class="math inline">\((f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_m)\)</span>
                be an IFS satisfying the OSC, and let each <span
                class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> denote the
                contraction ratio of each <span
                class="math inline">\(f_i\)</span>. Then the unique real
                number <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> such that
                <span class="math display">\[
                    \sum_{i = 1}^{m} c_i^s = 1
                \]</span> is the Hausdorff dimension of the attractor
                for the IFS.</p>
                <p>Intuitively, this makes sense when viewed from a sort
                of conservation of Hausdorff measure. We can split the
                fractal <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> into each
                <span class="math inline">\(f_i(U)\)</span> component,
                of which the set is scaled by <span
                class="math inline">\(c_i^s\)</span>. Invoking <a
                href="#problem215">Problem 2.1.5</a> and asserting that
                measures of each component must add up to their whole,
                we get this condition. Although not every IFS satisfies
                the OSC, this is extremely useful for finding the
                Hausdorff dimensions of attractors whose IFSs do satisfy
                the OSC.</p>

                <p>Note that <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is

                <p><em>Proof.</em> Decompose <span
                class="math inline">\(r\)</span> as <span

                decimal expansion of <span class="math inline">\(\{ r

                <span class="math inline">\(\{ r \}\)</span> to <span
                class="math inline">\(i\)</span> digits. Observe that
                each <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is
                necessarily rational and <span class="math display">\[
                    |r - q_i| &lt; 10^{-i}
                .\]</span> It now suffices to choose an <span
                class="math inline">\(i\)</span> such that <span
                class="math inline">\(10^{-i} &lt; \varepsilon\)</span>,
                which is possible if <span class="math inline">\(i &gt;
                - \log{\varepsilon} / \log 10\)</span>. Since <span
                class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is rational, we can
                conclude that a set of Hausdorff dimension <span

                there exists a set with Hausdorff dimension arbitrarily

                before we ran out of time and ideas. Perhaps in the
