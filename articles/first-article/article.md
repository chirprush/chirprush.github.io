This is mainly just a test article to see if my custom static website generator
(a wrapper over Pandoc, how unique) works!

## Future Writings

Since you're here, though, I might as well lay out what I intend to write here:

- **Math stuff**: There's much to explore and learn in the realm of
mathematics, and I've barely scratched the surface when it comes to the higher
level stuff. I want to learn and write a whole bunch about group theory,
topology perhaps, number theory, combinatorics, basically anything that I
find interesting.
- **Comp Sci stuff**: In a similar vein to mathematics, there's so much I have
to learn and talk about when it comes to comp sci stuff. There's data
structures/algorithms, but also really cool niche stuff like SIMD and shader
programming and all that. So yeah, there's a lot I want to hopefully cover
- **Japanese stuff**: I'm not actively studying Japanese much anymore (moreso
just going with immersion), but it could be nice to write down some
musings or just what I like about the grammar.
- **Life musings**: It's not a blog if I'm not philosophical y'know.

## Conclusion

No promises on when I write stuff; I'd like to ideally strike a balance between
not feeling pressured to write but also at the very least writing a bit every
once in a while. After I have a whole bunch of content, it'll be fun to see what
I can do with it (visualizations like graphs of links between articles, etc.).
